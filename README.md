## Future Features

### High Priority
- [ ] Eliminate JavaScript code. Make appropriate replacements using Rust.
  - [ ] Implement static site generation using Rust: pre-render one-time modifications at build time and output the result to the `/doc` folder.
  - [ ] Use Rust to generate client-side WebAssembly for interactive elements, starting with the color theme toggle.
- [ ] Move `iconConfigs` object to a standalone JSON file.

### Unsorted

- [ ] Add expertise/field-of-interest next to current role/position. Example: "EdTech Dev" or something similar
- [ ] New section for "personal statement"  or "summary"
- [ ] New section or page: `/stack` to highlight the software suite I use on a daily basis (dev and/or general)
- [ ] To projects add: dates, role, skills involved
- [ ] Continue to add icons where applicable
- [ ] Porting JavaScript to Rust-generated WebAssembly
- [ ] In "skill sets", differentiate between specific technologies (e.g. VirtualBox) v.s. "meta" idea (e.g. virtualization) 
- [ ] New section for "general background". Though, careful as it may be too personal
- [ ] Collecting metrics: A way to capture statistics of page visits over time, frequency of link clicks, etc.
- [] Fix: tooltip boxes don't behave as expected in darkmode (background should be white)
